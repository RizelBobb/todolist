My To Do List Application
Add, enter, update, and remove a new task to the list--to improve your time management skills!

How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, and JQuery

1. I appended the values the user inputs to an unordered list
2. Following that , I appended an edit and delete button to each of the items on the list
3. I then applied content editable to each of the items, so that when the user clicks an item, they can change their response.
4. I created two buttons to delete the whole list, or to delete individual items. 
5. I made a function that gave an updated count of how many tasks needed to be complete--when the user added or deleted a task from the list
6. I toggled a strikethrough class to allow the user to cross out completed tasks
Optimizations
If I had more time: 
I would replaceWith() to make the list editable instead of using content editable.
I would write more dry code.
I also want that when you press the appended edit button, it would not cross out the list item.

Lessons Learned:
I learned about appending buttons, I learned about mouse over methods, and I learned about the content editable feature.
I also learned about debugging your code.
